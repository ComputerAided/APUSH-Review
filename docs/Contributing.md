# Contributing

This started out as a personal project to help me study for APUSH, but I wanted to make it public so everyone could have access to study materials for the AP test.

## What to Contribute

Ideally, I'd want for this repository to include notes on all of the major topics covered within each chapter and basically to serve as an extended glossary of everything taught in APUSH. If you have notes that cover something not already included, I'd love to add them into this project.

## How to Contribute

If you want to add any of your personal notes to this repository, download and clone the repository with [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Create your own [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) of the repository, edit and add what you need, and then submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). I can then accept it and add your notes to the repository.

If this is your first time contributing, make sure that you add your name to the Contributors.md file so that I can give you credit.
